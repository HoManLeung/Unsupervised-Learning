# Unsupervised-Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data

1. Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into  clusters. This is a great tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems,search engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and more.

2. Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and use this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production line or a new trend in a time series.

3. Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the  probability density function(PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. This is commonly used for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization.
